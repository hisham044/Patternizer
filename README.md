# Patternizer
Patternizer is a Python project that allows users to create patterns using the turtle module. Upon running the program, the user is prompted in the terminal to input various parameters. These parameters include the background color, pen color, shape color, shape type, shape size, and gap distance between shapes.

The program uses dictionaries to map the input number to a corresponding color or shape. The user can also input a hexadecimal color code for the background and pen colors. The program also includes a function that checks whether a user-inputted color code is valid.

Once all the parameters have been inputted, the program utilizes a function called draw_shape to draw the desired shape with the specified parameters. The draw_shape function takes in the shape number, pen color, shape color, shape size, and a turtle object. It then uses the turtle module to draw the desired shape with the specified parameters.

Overall, Patternizer is a fun and interactive program that allows users to create unique and colorful patterns with ease.
